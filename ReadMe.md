This project shares WARP board SDR sources based on Mango Reference Design License.
("Mango Communications 802.11 Reference Design, http://mangocomm.com/802.11".)

In 802.11 reference design sources, we mainly modified dcf_mac.c files for the data frame jammer and the ack frame injector in IEEE 802.11.

To use this sources in WARP boards for data frame jammer or ACK frame injector in IEEE 802.11,

download "Mango_802.11_RefDes_v1.6.2.zip" in http://warpproject.org/trac/, and replace "svn_src" folder with our folder (data jammer or ACK injector).
